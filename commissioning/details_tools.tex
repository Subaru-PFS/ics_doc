\subsection{Required Tools}\label{sec:required_tools}
As shown the above, a various tools are requires, some of which is used for scientific operation and other of which is designated for the commissioning (or engineering).
Table \ref{tbl:tools} summarizes input and output of individual tools.

Gen2 command to open/close MCS shutter. 	&  Shutter moves and its status returns.	& Shutter movement and status are consistent.	&  	\\  \hline
Gen2 command to acquire MCS image. 	&  Shutter moves (if needed) and MCS image is saved.	& Image is acquired with name and headers along with datamodel, and is archived. &  \\  \hline
Gen2 command to read MCS temperatures. 	&  Values of the temperature sensors return. 	& The temperature values are correct.	&  \\  \hline
Gen2 command to read MCS coolant flow. 	&  Value of the flow meter returns.	& The flow value is correct.	&  \\  \hline
(Gen2 command to listen microphone?) 	&  Sound from microphone.	& Sound is transferred correctly.	& How to transfer audio is under discussion.  \\  \hline
