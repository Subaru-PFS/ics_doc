\subsection{Required Tools}\label{sec:required_tools}
As shown the above, a various tools are requires, some of which is used for scientific operation and other of which is designated for the commissioning (or engineering).
Table \ref{tbl:tools} summarizes input and output of individual tools.

Gen2 command to acquire MCS image. 	&  Shutter moves (if needed) and MCS image is saved.	& Image is acquired with name and headers along with datamodel, and is archived. & Check if the fine exist in target place. Check the filename and header. & \\  \hline
Gen2 command to open/close MCS shutter. 	&  Shutter moves and its status returns.	& Shutter movement and status are consistent.	& Take image after moving shutter. Alternatively, hear shutter moving using microphone. & 	\\  \hline
Gen2 command to read MCS temperatures. 	&  Values of the temperature sensors return. 	& The temperature values are correct.	& See if the sensor value is reasonable by compare the dome temperature and/or history. & \\  \hline
Gen2 command to read MCS coolant flow. 	&  Value of the flow meter returns.	& The flow value is correct.	& See if the sensor value is reasonable. &  \\  \hline
(Gen2 command to listen microphone?) 	&  Sound from microphone.	& Sound is transferred correctly.	& Make some sound around the microphone and listen to it. & How to transfer audio is under discussion.  \\  \hline
Gen 2 command to execute the above in sequence. 	&  Outputs of individual commands.	& Individual commands succeeded.	&  	\\ \hline \hline

Gen2 command ``for IIC" to change the telescope Az. after taking image.	&  Images are taken before and while telescope moves.	&  Az. moves after an MCS exposure.	& Check telescope status and/or MCS image and if the telescope moves. &  Demonstration of ``callback" function. \\  \hline

Gen2 command to acquire a series of MCS images ($\sim$ 10 or 20 frames). 	&  MCS images are saved.	& Images are acquired and archived. & See if the images exist in target place. &  \\  \hline
(Gen2) command to measure the spot centroids. 	&  Spots are identified and their centroids are measured.	& Centroids are measured and saved with IDs. & Check the (ICS/MCS) database. &  \\  \hline

Position on MCS.  	&  Position on F3C.	& Coordinates are transformed within accuracy of TBC um (on prime focal plane). & Compare calculated positions to hole positions as designed. & Coordinates transformation function will be developed in analyzing the data. \\  \hline
