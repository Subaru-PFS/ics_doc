\subsubsection{Data acuquisition of standard stars [Nighttime]}\label{secflow:StdStar}

% \milestone{The light is delivered from the primary mirror to the detectors for the first time.}

During the commissioning, the data acquisition of the following standard stars are necessary:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flux standard stars
    \item Radial velocity standard stars
    \item Telluric line standard stars
    \item (Abundance standard stars)
    \item ($\log g$ standards stars)
\end{itemize}
for DRPs development.
Note that abundance and $\log g$ measurements are out of scope of the DRP performance since they are not measured by 1D-DRP.

Assuming that the fibers don't need to be configured so precisely, we may take these standards by selecting the fields for processes \ref{secflow:1stDM} and \ref{secflow:raster}.

\paragraph{Designated Tool fot This Process}
Nothing, as this is data acquisition by setting the targets for other tests.
DRP team will develop their tools using the data.

\begin{itembox}[l]{\suctitle{Success Criteria}}
Acquire enough data of the standard stars.

\bluetext{Required long time to analyze the data?: No. \\
--- DRP team will develop their tools uing the data.
