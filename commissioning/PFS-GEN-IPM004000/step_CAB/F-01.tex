\subsubsection{Connection of Cables [Daytime]}\label{secflow:FibConcec}

In this step,  we connect Cable C--B (PFI) and Cable B--A (SpS)\footnote{The connection of Cable B--A may be not off so often once it has connected.}.
We check the connection of of the Cables with the fiber monitoring system.
Alternatively, we can also confirm the connection of the Cables by taking the calibration lamp image.

\begin{itembox}[l]{\suctitle{Success Criteria}}
Cable B is connected to PFI (Cable C) and SpS (Cable A) correctly.
