\subsection{Work-flow overview}

The ultimate goal of the PFS commissioning work-flow is to optimize the PFS performance and validate the goodness for scientific use.
To achieve this goal, we proceed the PFS commissioning following this outline:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Integrate PFS subsystems of which the performances have been validated by the PFS collaborators.
\item Operate the system and confirm their functions on the telescope.
\item Characterize the system, e.g. by calibrating the coordinate systems to put the fibers on the targets with required accuracy.
\item Evaluate the on-sky performance and validate it. \\
Firstly we focus on verifying the performances at given telescope positions, rotation angles even if we cannot confirm the same performance at all positions.
\item Finally, stabilize the instrument performances. \\
We optimize software, re-configuration sequence, calibration and so on.
We validate the performance at any telescope pointing or time.
\end{enumerate}

The latest top-level requirements are described on the following page: \\
{\tt http://sumire.pbworks.com/w/page/76118150/System\%20level\%20requirements}\\
See also the compliance matrix in section \ref{sec:cmatrix}.

\bigskip

The work-flow of the PFS commissioning (Fig. \ref{fig:flowchart}) consists of five parts: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Validation of MCS (labeled with M-\#, see section \ref{sec:MCS})
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Validation of MCS basic functions.
 \item Pre-study of the coordinate transformation using pinhole array on POpt2.
 \end{itemize}
This part requires only MCS.
\item Validation of PFI (labeled with P-\#, see section \ref{sec:PFI}), basically prior to SpS delivery at Subaru.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Alignment of WFC with the primary mirror.
 \item Telescope pointing analysis.
 \item AG camera validation.
 \item Confirmation of PFI--MCS relation (registration of Fixed Fiducial Fibers in F3C).
 \item Make the first-pass distortion map using AGCs (sky).
 \end{itemize}
This part requires only PFI basically, but some processes need MCS, too.
\item Validation of SpS (labeled with S-\#, see section \ref{sec:SpS})
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Validation of image quality and stability in the SCR.
 \item Characterization of SMs.
 \end{itemize}
This part requires SMs and SCR.
We don't need the telescope to carry out this part.
\item Validation of FoCCoS--Cable B (labeled with F-\#, see section \ref{sec:FoCCoS})
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Validation of cable connection.
 \item Confirmation of fibers ID on MCS and SpS.
 \end{itemize}
This part requires all subsystems: MCS, PFI, Cable B and SpS.
\item Commissioning of all systems (labeled with A-\#, see section \ref{sec:All}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Cobra calibration.
 \item PSF characterization.
 \item Make the second-pass distortion map using fibers (sky).
 \item Validation of all observational sequence.
 \item Fiber-reconfiguration.
 \item Performance verification:
 	\begin{itemize}
	\item Flux calibration
	\item Sky subtraction
	\item Total throughput
	\item Maximum exposure time of one frame, and stacking for long time ($>$ 10 hours) exposure
	\item Quality Assurance procedure
	\item Beam-switching mode
 \end{itemize}
 \item Stabilization of the instrument performance and operation.
 \end{itemize}
This part requires all subsystems: MCS, PFI, Cable B and SpS.
\end{enumerate}

During the commissioning procedure, we also verify the software sequence for observation (acquisition, fiber configuration, guiding, and exposure) at suitable commissioning sequences.
We also verify the data reduction pipeline (DRP), and quality-assurance (QA) process and so on.

%%% Subsystem I \& T and capable functions at delivery
\subsection{Subsystem I \& T (TBD)}
\subsubsection{I \& T at Subaru}
Each subsystem is delivered to Subaru separately.
After the delivery, collaborators will re-assemble modules (if needed) and test their performance.
In this section, the brief summary of I\&T of subsystems are described.
See the documents by collaborators (TBA) for detailed procedure of I\&T.

Table \ref{tbl:SubSysIandT} summarizes schedule and place of I\&T of subsystems.
The validated functions before shipping (or before commissioning) is listed in Table \ref{tbl:subfuncs}.
The file named {\tt PFS\_AIT\_Subaru.pptx}\footnote{http://sumire.pbworks.com/w/file/111633073/PFS\_AIT\_Subaru.pptx} summarizes The required sources, layout of working space and other configurations of I\&T process in Hawaii

\paragraph{PFI}
PFI wll be shipped after assembled at ASIAA/ASRD, so it doesn't need to be re-assembled at Subaru, except for the field element.
The field element will be disassembled for protection, so that it will be integrated again at the Summit.
%, according to the latest I\&T story board.
%After shipped, PFI is re-adjusted if needed.
Although the I\&T story board at the summit is in preparation, the currently assumed test items are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fiber transparency tests
\item Rotational test for Cable Wrapper
\item Power on/off test (fiducial fiber illuminator etc.)
\item Image acquisition (central camera, fiducial fiber viewing cameras, and AG cameras)
\item Cobra circular motion test
\item Dot position check
\item Cobra convergence test with dummy MCS
\item AG camera test for dark and noise
\item Integration of Field Element and calibration lamp
\item Fitting test with POpt2
\end{enumerate}
These test are carried out using test stand on which PFI will be shipped, and dummy MCS.
Because the tilt mechanism is not assumed to be delivered so far, the test should be limited compared to AIT phase at ASIAA.

After the above tests are passed, PFI will be installed to POpt2, and the the same tests are repeated, except for the cobra circular motion test and integration.

Software modules controlling PFI will be also integrated on-site ICS.
Not only communication among ICS individual modules, but also communication among ICS Actors and MLP1 will be tested.
Also, telemetry system, communication among PFI software actors, SAS, and STS will be validated.

\paragraph{MCS}
After AIT at ASIAA, MCS will be shipped to Subaru without disassembling.
The optical alignment of the subsystem will be checked using laser at Hilo base, then the subsystem will be transported to the Summit.

At the Summit, the image quality will be checked with the pinhole array, the achromatic lens will be installed, and MCS will be installed MCBox.
ASIAA will also adjust the alignment of MCS with respect to the prime focus, because MCS will be mounted to CsBox only ``mechanically".
Such a test enables us to use time efficiently before PFI arrival, and to save time after PFI arrival, which is expected one year later than MCS arrival, because we should align MCS with the prime focus firstly.
After the alignment, the image quality will be also checked under the more realistic observational condition (e.g. dome seeing).
This test will be performed using the pinhole array can be equipped on POpt2.
Note that the I\&T process using Popt2 with pinhole array will be done combining to MCS commissioning process (\ref{secflow:prestudy}).

Because MCS is the first subsystem delivered to Subaru, the ICS infrastructure will be prepared to accommodate MHS and ICS actors.
MCS software modules are hooked up to the MHS running on the summit infrastructure.

\paragraph{SpS}
After AIT at LAM, four modules are shipped to Subaru separately.
Individual modules are re-assembled in SCR on the IR4 floor, and the following test will be carried out (TBC):
\begin{itemize}
\item Thermal function (cooling down /warming up)
\item Image quality and stability
\item Characterization of spectrograph  (optional: TBD)
\end{itemize}

SpS software modules are also integrated and tested.

\paragraph{Cable B}
After shipped to Subaru, the light-path will be tested firstly. 
FRD is measured before and after installation on the telescope, and in the middle of it in order to check extra stress have induced to the fibers during installation process.
Uniformity test using USB microscope is carried out.
Besides, spectral transmission are tested for a set of fibers.
To test the cables on the telescope, the dedicated connector making loops on Tower connector side is used.
% Then the cable is installed to the telescope, while the fiber connection monitoring system is installed to the IR3 floor.

For Fiber Monitoring System, only low-level command is available, so software integration is needed.

\subsubsection{Complementarity between subsystem I\& T and the commissioning}
To be written.

\subsection{Expected Number of Nights for Validation \& Commissioning (TBC)}
%Assuming that 1 run amounts 5--7 nights (and/or daytime) including 1 day each for installing/uninstalling the instruments, we estimate the number of required runs for the PFS validation \& commissioning procedure.
The PFS commissioning requires several ``engineering observation runs", during which a few processes will be executed step by step.
We estimate the number of required runs and working-days for the PFS commissioning procedure.
For most of the tests the night time (sky) is essential, but for some tests, day-time is acceptable.
14-day works require dark night in later phase of the commissioning, where we shall validate the total instrument performance.
We arrange the working process to use the telescope time as effectively as possible.
In total, {\bf 10 runs of 45 working days} will be  required for the commissioning. 
Here, we take account into the weather factor of 70 \% uniformly  for nighttime processes.
We also include the uniform 20 \% technical margin into each process for unseen situations.

At the first run when PFS observes the sky, 3 nights will be required for Mitsubishi to test the updated software to control the telescope.
Also, to check the performance the algorithm for PFI alignment (\ref{secflow:WFCTiltShift}) and study the distortion, 7 nights were used with HSC from the S17B to the S21A semester.
Combined with these numbers, {\bf 52 working days} will be required for the PFS commissioning.

The expected numbers of working-days for each run and its breakdown is as below.
Figures \ref{fig:run1} -- \ref{fig:run9}  display the rough schedule of runs 1--9, from installation of subsystems before the engineering observation to their uninstallation after the run.
Here, commissioning processes which require dark night-sky are colored by navy, while ones requiring night-sky even bright/grey by blue.
Processes we can carry out even in the daytime are colored by pink.
%Here numbers of parentheses are required days for only sequences.
Table \ref{tbl:CountDates} summarizes these numbers with schedule on the assumption of the current timeline of the project (as of April 2018).

%It should be noted that this calculation is for ideal case --- no trouble on each subsystem, nor telescope, in addition to the perfect weather.
Note that we do not count the required days for validation of SpS (seq. S-\#) for the above estimation, because the telescope time is not occupied with PFS during its validation.
Note also that we do not count working days for MCS on-telescope test in June 2018, before the run 1, because the telescope will not be occupied on nights.

\subsection{Relationship among Individual Sequence}
Some processes can be carried out in parallel, but some should in series.
Table \ref{tbl:Rel_Seq} shows the relationship among the individual sequences.
Each row displays commissioning processes related to each process in the columns.
``X" means required process.
For example, prior to the process M--3, M--2 (and hence M--1) should be succeeded.
