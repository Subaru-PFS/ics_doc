\subsubsection{POpt 2 installation to Telescope [Daytime]}\label{secflow:PFIinstall}
In this process,  POpt2 is installed to the Prime Focus of the telescope.

According to {\tt TM-N5143 (section 3.1.6)}, the accuracy in installing POpt2 to the top ring (and hence optical axis of the primary mirror) are determined by repeatability in engaging of curvic coupling.
The repeatability is within 10 um in X,Y,Z direction, and 3.4 arcsec tilt.
This is small enough, compared to the required repeatability in setting PFI to POpt2 (see \ref{secflow:PFIoff}).

We won't check how accurately PFI$+$POpt2 is installed, but will check repeatability by measuring the FoV center of PFI on MCS camera in the process \ref{secflow:PFIoffset}.
Once the repeatability will be found insufficient, we will have to check installation procedure of both PFI and MCS.

We also install MCS to the Cassegrain Focus, basically one (or more) day before installation of POpt2.
