\subsubsection{Refine of the PFI -- MCS relation [Daytime]}\label{secflow:mcs2f3c}
After the alignment of WFC with the primary mirror is confirmed at a given telescope position, we confirm and refine PFI--MCS relation using fiducial fibers in this sequence (see also section \ref{sec:coord_calib}).

Prior to the integration, the Focal Plane from the viewpoint of MCS (PFI--MCS relation) has been calculated with ZEMAX, using the WFC as-built model.
Using the ZEMAX calculation, we derive the form of relation in advance.
%This relation can be predicted by fitting the relation with a given function.
\redtext{(the function form: TBD)}

In this sequence, we refine the position of the fixed fiducial fibers on F3C.
%At the beginning of this sequence, we use this function.
We take the images of back-lit fixed fiducial fibers with MCS, and transform the centroid on MCSC to F3C.
The physical positions of fixed fiducial fibers on focal plane, on the other hand, are measured during I\&T at ASIAA before shipment.
We compare those two positions and check the consistency.
%the relation between fiber position on PFI ($x_{PFI}, y_{PFI}$) and on MCS ($x_{MCS}, y_{MCS}$).
%If the transformed positions is different from the original ones on F3C, the function shall be improved.
%We shall derive the PFI--MCS relation at various El. and ROA in order to check the dependency on them, and minimize the error of the function.

If the positions of fixed fiducial fibers are consistent between F3C and physical position, the position on F3C are registered.
The positions with terrible discrepancy shall be excluded from F3C.
%The improved PFI--MCS relations are sent to coordinate transformation system as MCS--F3C transformation function.
At this point, the transforming function from the MCS coordinate to the F3C coordinate is defined.

Once MCS-F3C transformation is confirmed, MPS can send command for moving the Cobras to dot position.
We verify this command, by taking the images with the fibers on-/off- dots after the Cobra calibration \ref{secflow:CobraCal}.

\begin{itembox}[l]{\suctitle{Success Criteria}}
PFI--MCS relation is calibrated and MCSC--F3C transformation is confirmed. \\
%MPS command for dot position is validated.

\bluetext{Required long time to analyze the data?: No. \\
