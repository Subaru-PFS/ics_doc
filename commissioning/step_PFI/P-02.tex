\subsubsection{POpt 2 installation to Telescope [Daytime]}\label{secflow:PFIinstall}
In this step,  POpt2 is installed to the Prime Focus of the telescope.

According to {\tt TM-N5143 (section 3.1.6)}, the accuracy in installing POpt2 to the top ring (and hence optical axis of the primary mirror) are determined by repeatability in engaging of curvic coupling.
The repeatability is within 10 um in X,Y,Z direction, and 3.4 arcsec tilt.
This is small enough, compared to the required repeatability in setting PFI to POpt2 (see \ref{secflow:PFIoff}).

We also install MCS to the Cassegrain Focus, basically one (or more) day before installation of POpt2.

\paragraph{Designated Tool for This Step}
Nothing.
