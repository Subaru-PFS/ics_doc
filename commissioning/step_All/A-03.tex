\subsubsection{Calibration of the Distance b/w A\&G Cameras and the Fixed Fiducial Fibers [Night-time]}\label{secflow:agc2fff}

In this step, we calibrate the position of the A\&G cameras relative to their fixed fiducial fibers, in order to make the sky-PFI relation  consistent between A\&G cameras and the field of view.

Firstly, we slew the telescope to have a star in the center of an A\&G camera.
Then we move the telescope to have the AG fixed fiducial fiber pointed to the star.
We execute the raster scan around the fixed fiducial fiber and calibrate the distance between A\&G camera and the fiber.
Because one A\&G camera has two fiducial fibers on both sides in the azimuth direction, the raster scan should be carried out using both fibers.
Therefore, we shall do $12 \times n$ raster scan in total.

Using the calibrated data, the transformation from Sky Catalogue ti F3C is updated.
