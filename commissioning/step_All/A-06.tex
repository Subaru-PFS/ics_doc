\subsubsection{Performance Verification II [Night-time]}\label{secflow:PV2}

By the previous commissioning sequences, the instrument performance shall be verified at given telescope position.
In this this commissioning phase, we stabilize the operation and performance at any telescope positions for long-term surveys.

We repeat the same procedure as \ref{secflow:PV2}, optimizing the software and operation.
