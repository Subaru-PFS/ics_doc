\subsubsection{Measurement of Cobra Center Positions and Other Parameters [Daytime]}\label{secflow:CobraCal}

In this step, we measure the center position and other parameters of the fiber positioner ``Cobras".
In order for MPS to send commands for moving Cobras, MPS should should obtain firstly the following parameters (Figure \ref{fig:Cobraparams}):
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bm{X_{c,k}}=(x_{c,k}, y_{c,k})$ : center position of the positioner
\item $a_{1,k}$: arm lengths of $\theta$ stage
\item $a_{2,k}$: arm lengths of $\phi$ stage
\item $\bm{\theta _{\mathrm{CW},k}}$: CW limit of $\theta$ stage (angle or position)
\item $\bm{\phi _{\mathrm{CW},k}}$: CW limit of $\phi$ stage (angle or position)
\item $\bm{\theta _{\mathrm{CCW},k}}$: CCW limit of $\theta$ stage (angle or position), and
\item $\bm{\phi_{\mathrm{CCW},k}}$: CCW limit of $\phi$ stage (angle or position).
\end{itemize}
Note that these parameters are calculated in F3C.
We shall derive these parameters in this phase using back-illuminated fibers.

Prior to the measurement, we should confirm that the science fibers can be back-illuminated, that is, the Back Illumination Assembly in the SpS subsystem does work (see \ref{secflow:PFIon}).
At this point, we regulate the brightness of back-illumination.
The brightness of back-illuminated fibers are set based on that of the science fibers illuminated in the strobe mode, whose brightness is fixed ($1 \; \mathrm{[W\;m^{-2} \; sr^{-1}]} \pm 20 \%$).
Firstly, we shall regulate the brightness the brightness of the fiducial fibers comparing with that of science fibers illuminated in the strobe mode.
Secondary, we shall adjust the brightness of science fibers back-lit in the normal mode to that of fiducial fibers. 

After tuning the brightness of the light sources, we shall back-illuminate the science fibers in the strobe mode, with which the fibers blink.
We shall take blinking fibers image using MCS with ``Cobra" rotating.
Then we shall measure the centroid of the positioner, arm lengths, and minimum and maximum positions of each stage, by fitting the spots with a circle on F3C.
Here, we move $\theta$ and $\phi$ stage individually to determine these parameters.
The detailed procedure is presented in {\tt SSN-00021-001+-MPSconfiguration.pptx} (by Atsushi Shimono).
\redtext{How high is frequency of the pulse in strobe mode?}

We also check dependency of the offset of fiducial fibre positions at various RoA and El, although the offset is negligible given that PFI should be solid.
If the displacement of the fiducial fibers is quite large and randomly, we should improve MCS--PFI relation, which is determined in the \ref{secflow:mcs2f3c} process.

Derived parameters are sent to MPS, which can move cobras at this point.
Then, we also validate the following items:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the SpS and Cable B are installed, the science fibers are moved to the home position several times to test good repeatability ($\sim$1um)
\item Dots can be obscure the Fibers.
We move the fibers to the dot positions and turn on the calibration lamp.
Take fibers image by MCS and compare with that of home position, where the fibers are not obscured.
If dots work, the spots in MCS is fainter than those with the fibers at home position.
\end{itemize}

\redtext{
NOTE: This sequence will be carried out only when ALL science fibers can be back illuminated to avoid collisions.
Although SM3,4 will be delivered one year later than SM1,2, we shall back-illuminate all fibers and then save Cobra positions for SM3,4.
%Cobras for SM1 and SM2 can be calibrated prior to those for SM3 and SM4.
%However, to avoid collisions between neighboring fiber positioners, ALL fibers are needed to back-illuminated.
%If the function of BIA for all SMs are confirmed, this sequence can be executed prior to \ref{secflow:P09}
