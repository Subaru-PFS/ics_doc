\section{Test Case SPS-ALERT-CHEADER-100: CCD Header Outside Range}

\subsection{Description}

Checks that expected alarm is raised when the CCD Header is outside range.

\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] Expected alert seen on GUI and written to log when the CCD Header measurement is outside range
\item [Fail] Any result otherwise. For example:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item No alert raised when cooler power is outside range
    \item Unexpected alert raised while CCD Header is in fact {\it within} allowed range
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}

\subsection{Hardware constraints}

Cryostat is cooled?

\subsection{Initial conditions}

SM module and temperature board deactivated. AlertsActor deactivated.

\subsection{Procedure}

Repeat procedure described in~\ref{sec:alerts-proc}, with \texttt{key=heaters} and range \texttt{0, null}.
