\section{Test Case SPS-BIAS-140: Detector Bias}

\subsection{Description}

Take a bias on a given detector, check that the file is created correctly and fits header critical keys are set.
Check that \texttt{IMAGETYP==BIAS} and \texttt{exptime==0}


\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] filepath and fits header keys be generated and command should finish with `\texttt{test=bias-cam,OK}'
\item [Fail] If an exception is raised `\texttt{test=bias-cam,FAILED}' will be generated with its full trace.

\end{description}

\subsection{Hardware constraints}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item SPS RACK powered up
    \item BEE powered up.
    \item Fee powered up
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Initial conditions}

ccdActor and testsActor started

\subsection{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item testsActor : send bias test command: \texttt{tests bias cam=r1} .
    \item wait for the command to end.
\end{enumerate}
