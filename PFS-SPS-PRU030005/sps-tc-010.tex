\section{Test Case SPS-ALERT-TRIGGER-010: Alerts trigger mechanism}

\subsection{Description}

Checks an expected alarm is raised using different alert mechanisms :
\begin{enumerate}
    \item LIMITS ALERT :  value within bounds.
    \item REGEXP ALERT : regular expression.
    \item Callback : dedicated python function.
\end{enumerate}

Dedicated testsActor keywords are tracked by alertsActor.
A command is sent to testsActor to generate out of range values and therefore trigger the alerts.


\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] Expected alerts seen STS server side and written to log when the alerts are triggered.
\item [Fail] Any result otherwise. For example:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item an expected alert is raised when all keytest1 values are not within 160-166
    \item an expected alert is raised when keytest2 value is above 1.0e-6
    \item an expected alert is raised when keytest3[1] is not "OK"
\end{enumerate}
\end{description}


\subsection{Initial conditions}

alertsActor and testsActor started

\subsection{Procedure}
\label{sec:alerts-proc}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item AlertsActor : connect tests controller: \texttt{alerts connect controller=tests}
    \item wait 30 seconds, keywords are generated within ranges, no alerts are raised yet
    \item TestsActor : trigger the alerts: \texttt{tests alerts trigger}
    \item AlertsActor : disconnect tests controller: \texttt{alerts disconnect controller=tests}
\end{enumerate}
