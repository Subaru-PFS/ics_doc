\item [Fail] Any result otherwise.
\end{description}

\subsection{Hardware constraints}

None.

\subsection{Initial conditions}

\texttt{/data} and \texttt{/software} volumes are created.

\subsection{Procedure}

For each volume:

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{|l| p{5cm} |l| p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    {\bf Step} & {\bf Description} & {\bf Pass/FAIL} & {\bf Comment}  \\ \hline
    1 & Create small files &  &  \\ \hline
    2 & Read those files &  &  \\ \hline
    3 & Copy those files to new locations within same volume and check that they are readable. &  &  \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Additional Notes}

A test script installed in the \texttt{/software} folder would address this test effectively.
