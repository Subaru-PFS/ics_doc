\section{Test Case SPS-REXM-180: Red exchange mechanism movement}
\subsection{Description}

Check the communication with rexm motor controller, check that the statuses are correct.
Checks that the red exchange mechanism moves as expected:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item for each position : low resolution, medium resolution
        \item command rexm to be moved to that position
        \item check whether the expected position is reached with a correct timing
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{|l| p{5cm} |l| p{5cm} |}
    \hline
    {\bf Step} & {\bf Description}  \\ \hline
    1 & Initialization, low position \\ \hline
    2 & Go to med position \\ \hline
    3 & Go back to low position \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] Rexm movement as expected {'test=rexm-smId,OK'}
\item [Fail] If an exception is raised \texttt{'test=rexm-smId,FAILED'} will be generated with its full trace.
\end{description}

\subsection{Hardware constraints}

Enu rack powered up and connected to the PFS network

\subsection{Initial conditions}
enuActor and testsActor started

\subsection{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item testsActor : send rexm test command: \texttt{tests rexm sm1} .
    \item wait for the command to end.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Additional Notes}

None..
