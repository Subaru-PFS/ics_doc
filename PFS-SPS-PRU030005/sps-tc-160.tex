\section{Test Case SPS-SHUTTER-160: Shutter control}

\subsection{Description}

Check the communication with the shutters, check that the statuses are correct.

Check movement for each shutter :
\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabular}{|l| p{10cm} |l| p{10cm} |}
    \hline
    {\bf Step} & {\bf Description}   \\ \hline
    1 & Ask for a 5 seconds exposure     \\ \hline
    2 & Check the exptime error is below 0.1 sec     \\ \hline
    3 & Check that the transient time is below 1 sec     \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}


\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] Shutters open/close as expected, with the correct speed \texttt{'test=shutters-smId,OK'}
\item [Fail] If an exception is raised \texttt{'test=shutters-smId,FAILED'} will be generated with its full trace.
\end{description}
