\section{Test Case SPS-ALERT-INVALID-020: Alerts invalid values mechanism}

\subsection{Description}

Checks that an expected alarm is raised when an invalid value is generated. Since dedicated testsActor keywords are tracked by alertsActor,
a command is sent to testsActor to generate invalid values and therefore trigger the alerts.


\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] Expected alerts seen STS server side and written to log when the alerts are triggered.
\item [Fail] Any result otherwise. For example:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item an expected alert is raised when at least one keytest1 field value is invalid
    \item an expected alert is raised when keytest2 value is invalid

\end{enumerate}
\end{description}


\subsection{Initial conditions}

alertsActor and testsActor started

\subsection{Procedure}
\label{sec:alerts-proc}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item AlertsActor : connect tests controller: \texttt{alerts connect controller=tests}
    \item wait 30 seconds, keywords are generated within ranges, no alerts are raised yet
    \item TestsActor : trigger the alerts: \texttt{tests alerts invalid}
    \item AlertsActor : disconnect tests controller: \texttt{alerts disconnect controller=tests}
\end{enumerate}
