\section{Test Case SPS-ALERT-TIMEOUT-030: Alerts values out-of-date}

\subsection{Description}

Checks that an expected alarm is raised when keyword values are no longer generated with \texttt{TIMELIM=180 secs}.
Since dedicated testsActor keywords are tracked by alertsActor,a command is sent to testsActor to stop to keyword generation and therefore trigger the alerts.

\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] Expected alerts seen on STS server side and written to log when the alerts are triggered.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  an expected TIMEOUT alert is raised after 180 seconds

\end{enumerate}
\item [Fail] no alerts are raised

\end{description}

\subsection{Hardware constraints}

None.

\subsection{Initial conditions}

alertsActor and testsActor started

\subsection{Procedure}
\label{sec:alerts-proc}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item AlertsActor : connect tests controller: \texttt{alerts connect controller=tests}
    \item wait 30 seconds, keywords are generated within ranges, no alerts are raised yet
    \item TestsActor : trigger the alerts: \texttt{tests alerts timeout}
    \item wait 180 seconds, keywords are no longer generated, alerts should be raised
    \item AlertsActor : disconnect tests controller: \texttt{alerts disconnect controller=tests}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Additional Notes}
None.
