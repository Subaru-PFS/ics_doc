\section{Test Case SPS-BIA-190: Check Back Illumination Assembly Photoresistance}

\subsection{Description}

Check the communication with biasha board, check that the statuses are correct.
Turn on the BIA and Check photoresistances values.

\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] The photoresistances are measured as expected. {'test=bia-smId,OK'}
\item [Fail] If an exception is raised \texttt{'test=bia-smId,FAILED'} will be generated with its full trace.
\end{description}

\subsection{Hardware constraints}
