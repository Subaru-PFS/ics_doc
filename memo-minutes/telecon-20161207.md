## Meeting Minutes

### ICS/SpS Minutes

#### Attendee

- Arnaud, Fabrice (LAM), Craig (Princeton), Yuki, Atsushi (IPMU)
- 2016/12/07 1500-1600 UTC

#### Minutes

- Reports from Craig's visit to LAM at week of 2016/11/27
  - 2D DRP at LAM successfully installed
  - Motor control for detector focus mechanism was not a software issue but mainly wiring issue
  - CCD actor updates
    - filed JIRA tickets for future works, e.g. 31 (BEE gate valve)
- Craig is planning to propose joining Robert's visit to LAM in mid-Jan
  - This can also good time to fix pending items during week of 2016/11/27
  - If this happens most of persons working on SpS software are at LAM, so 
  it is quite nice time also to call Atsushi+ and 
  to have extended discussion such as future development 
  plans towards full AIT software and pre-ship reviews before shipping to 
  subaru, also various un-fixed interfaces and sequences.
  - Craig will talk in Princeton, and also CC to the Project Office when he 
  sends coordination to LAM
- Fabrice found several saturated pixels at detector images of test illuminator 
  with arc lamp
  - Although there is some saturated pixels, most spots from arc lamp is quite 
  low counts and want to integrate more for good signal to noise ratio.
  - Anyone is not sure what are these saturated pixels, but will not harm even 
  for longer exposure
- New 20TB storage was setup for lab data at LAM
  - Had some issue on storage cordination at BEE, but already fixed and working
  with checking symlinks
  - We need to make document on BEE storage strategy and operation, such as 
  how to operate BEE with readonly mounted internal storage with NFS mounted 
  ones. Atsushi will file a new ticket on this.
- Going through old JIRA INSTRM issues
  - INSTRM-15: Craig will put new number for detector readout data rate

### ICS/PFI Minutes

#### Attendee

- Chih-Yi, Chi-Hung, Jennifer (ASIAA), Yuki, Atsushi (IPMU)
- 2016/12/07 2330-2415 UTC

#### Minutes

- Status update from ASIAA
  - Planning to have m2t test connection to Caltech from ASIAA over internet
    - Chi-Hung is contacting to Caltech on this
  - MCS AIT camera data acquisition started on implementation in Python
    - Also several AIT tools are under development, such as XY-stage, camera 
    image processing
  - Real MCS camera has located on rotating stage at lab
    - This enables to acquire rotated images and to test fiber identification 
    more in realistic situation
    - Using some sample mask, but not the same as real encoder fiber locations
      - How we can do such test using simulated encoder fibers, or not to do 
      need to be discussed during upcoming collaboration meeting including 
      Shiang-Yu
  - FCC USB camera inspection undergo, but haven't found a way to operate 
    under Linux
    - Chih-Yi will circulate camera USB interface information, such as vendor 
    and device IDs over USB, to the ICS list for wider range of information 
    gathering
- Towards MPS/m2t delivery readiness review
  - It was agreed importance to have some official readiness review before 
  shipping out from Caltech on MPS/Cobra related software
  - Also some documentation is required also on m2t side, especially for 
  one as a deliverable to Subaru
