## Minutes

### ICS/SpS

#### Attendee

- Arnaud, Fabrice (LAM), Craig (Princeton), Yuki, Atsushi (IPMU)
- 2016/12/07 1500-1600 UTC

#### Minutes

- Reports from Craig's visit to LAM at week of 2016/11/27
  - 2D DRP at LAM successfully installed
  - Motor control for detector focus mechanism was not a software issue but mainly wiring issue
  - CCD actor updates
    - filed JIRA tickets for future works, e.g. 31 (BEE gate valve)
- Craig is planning to propose joining Robert's visit to LAM in mid-Jan
  - This can also good time to fix pending items during week of 2016/11/27
  - If this happens most of persons working on SpS software are at LAM, so 
  it is quite nice time to have extended discussion such as future development 
  plans towards full AIT software and pre-ship reviews before shipping to 
  subaru, also various un-fixed interfaces and sequences.
  - Craig will talk in Princeton, and also CC to the Project Office when he 
  sends coordination to LAM
- Fabrice found several saturated pixels at detector images of test illuminator 
  with arc lamp
  - Although there is some saturated pixels, most spots from arc lamp is quite 
  low counts and want to integrate more for good signal to noise ratio.
  - Anyone is not sure what are these saturated pixels, but will not harm even 
  for longer exposure
- New 20TB storage was setup for lab data at LAM
  - Had some issue on storage cordination at BEE, but already fixed and working
  with checking symlinks
  - We need to make document on BEE storage strategy and operation, such as 
  how to operate BEE with readonly mounted internal storage with NFS mounted 
  ones. Atsushi will file a new ticket on this.
- Going through old JIRA INSTRM issues
  - INSTRM-15: Craig will put new number for detector readout data rate

### ICS/PFI

#### Attendee

- Chih-Yi, Chi-Hung, Jennifer (ASIAA), Yuki, Atsushi (IPMU)
- 2016/12/07 2330-2415 UTC

#### Minutes

- Status update from ASIAA
  - Planning to have m2t test connection to Caltech from ASIAA over internet
    - Chi-Hung is contacting to Caltech on this
  - MCS AIT camera data acquisition started on implementation in Python
    - Also several AIT tools are under development, such as XY-stage, camera 
    image processing
  - Real MCS camera has located on rotating stage at lab
    - This enables to acquire rotated images and to test fiber identification 
    more in realistic situation
    - Using some sample mask, but not the same as real encoder fiber locations
      - How we can do such test using simulated encoder fibers, or not to do 
      need to be discussed during upcoming collaboration meeting including 
      Shiang-Yu
  - FCC USB camera inspection undergo, but haven't found a way to operate 
    under Linux
    - Chih-Yi will circulate camera USB interface information, such as vendor 
    and device IDs over USB, to the ICS list for wider range of information 
    gathering
- Towards MPS/m2t delivery readiness review
  - It was agreed importance to have some official readiness review before 
  shipping out from Caltech on MPS/Cobra related software
  - Also some documentation is required also on m2t side, especially for 
  one as a deliverable to Subaru
