\section{Abstract}

To design computer hardware system including network connections for detector 
system of PFS, we need to study how much data rate is assumed for the entire 
system. 
Estimated data rate for detectors over the entire PFS instrument is 
summarized in this study report. 

Note: In version 1, 'ideas for computer hardware system' was included in this 
study note, to be used by further studies such as design of PFS network. 
Designs of instrument control modules and their hardware have been developed 
and (partly) implemented in other documents, these parts are removed from 
version 2.

\section{Detector operational condition and estimated data rate}

\subsection{Detector operational condition}

Operational conditions are summarized as Table.~\ref{datarate-cond} (science 
detectors in SpS/xCU), and Table.~\ref{datarate-cond-other} (others
\footnote{This lists only operational cameras, but excluding support cameras 
for monitoring and/or surveillance whose data will not be archived as FITS.}).

\subsection{Estimated data rate and operation conditions}

\subsubsection{CCD (SpS/[BR]CU)}

For CCD, since all readout will be destructive, we will readout only once 
per exposure. This readout will occur just after its exposure.

Total data size is 256MB per exposure which will be readout in 28.0 sec, 
and estimated data rate is 73 Mbps in total (all spectrographs) from SpS 
switch to PFS storage. 
Data transfer from PFS storage to Gen2 will occur right after FITS files are 
finalized by SpS/[BR]CU, its total data volume is 256MB (2Gbits). 


\subsubsection{IR detector (SpS/NCU)}

For IR detector, we will use two methods: Fowler sampling, up-the ramp. 
Still by data rate point of view, these two are the same -- we can concentrate 
on the maximum data rate. This ignores costs for real time data processing for 
finalizing as one data frame, though. 

The maximum data rate is one for up-the ramp sampling, which is continuous 
data flow with the specified readout speed. 
With the readout speed of 100 kHz and using 32 channels, one NCU generates 
51.2Mbps (6.4MB/s), and 5.76GB for 900sec exposure. 

Data transfer from SpS to PFS storage (at CB2F) will be \~{}200Mbps for one 
stream from all spectrographs \footnote{PFS may have up to two stream for 
each up-the-ramp data, one is for one FITS file per one full frame readout, 
and another is for stacked FITS file over one exposure. This can make total 
data transfer to be double over entire data readout during exposure.}. 

Data transfer from PFS storage to Gen2 has two parts: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item On the fly FITS file transfer with single up-the-ramp frame during 
    exposure, for health check of instrument during exposure
  \item FITS file for entire exposure with multiple (or all of) up-the-ramp 
    frame transferred after exposure finished, for archive of science data
\end{itemize}

For 1st part, a set of FITS files (4 files) of single up-the-ramp readout 
from all 4 NCUs will be transferred, and their total data size is 128MB 
(or 256MB if PFS handles real pixels and references in one pack). Minimum 
separation between two transfer is 5.3sec which is a time for full frame 
readout, but interval of sending to Gen2 is not defined for real operation. 
128MB can be transferred about 1sec with 1Gbps connection. 

For 2nd part, data size to be transferred depends on exposure time (total 
number of frames from up-the-ramp) and sampling rate (all up-the-ramp frame 
or picked up). For typical exposure time of 900 sec and all up-the-ramp frame, 
total data size (of 4 FITS files) is 23GB (184Gbits) for all spectrograph 
modules. 

\subsubsection{AGCC --- AG camera}

AG camera control computer is at CB2F with dedicated connection of PCIe bus 
extender to six AG cameras at PFI Cobra bench. No load to ethernet connection 
between CB2F and PFI for AG camera data transfer. 
Maximum data rate from six AGCC to PFS storage through AG camera control 
computer at CB2F, which flows only on PFS network switch at CB2F, 
is \~{}100Mbps (2MB x6 in 1Hz), 
for assumed normal operation of 2 cameras in 1Hz (for AG) and 1 camera in 
0.1Hz (for focusing) data rate is \~{}34Mbps. 

During AG running, two image transfer will run: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Image to V-LAN, 512 pixels sq. with 16bit (0.5MB each) with maximum 1Hz.
    For caching (data transfer frequency to V-LAN could be different from one 
    of AG camera readout) and debug (to be checked later) purpose, data sent 
    to V-LAN could be saved into PFS storage. 
  \item FITS file to Gen2 for operational display purpose but not to be 
    archived. This will be just transfer FITS files saved by AGCC. 
\end{itemize}

PFS is planning to archive guide star images of auto guiding, but details are 
not fixed yet. Maximum data size for assumed normal operation (2 cameras in 
1Hz for AG and 1 camera in 0.1Hz for focusing) and typical exposure time of 
900sec is \~{}3.8GB. 


\subsubsection{FCC --- Field center camera}

This camera is assumed to be used only on commissioning or special case of 
instrument health check.
This camera will not generate traffic during normal operation. 


\subsubsection{FVC --- Fiber viewing camera}

This camera is mounted at backside of fixed fiducial fibers in parallel to 
fixed fiducial back illuminator lamp system, and looks sky through fixed 
fiducial fibers, which is assumed to be used only on commissioning or special 
case of instrument health check. 
This camera will not generate traffic during normal operation. 

\subsubsection{MCS --- Metrology camera}

Metrology camera detector is operated in a rolling shutter mode of CMOS image 
sensor. As a system, MCS (Metrology camera system) has a mechanical shutter 
to control exposure time, and will stack into one output (single image is 
100MB, not yet defined for stacked image) for one exposure. 
Control computer of this camera is at Cs container, and images will be saved 
into local storage of the control computer. MCS is used during Cobra 
configuration between exposures (for normal operation), with around 5 to 10 sec 
interval and upto 10 times per configuration. 

The last exposure is assumed to be transferred to Gen2 through PFS storage, 
but not yet defined for other exposures.
