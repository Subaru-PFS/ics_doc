LDAP account
------

Use 
`LDIF generation script <https://github.com/Subaru-PFS/pfs_infra_ipmu.git>`_ 
for operation (`ldap-admin` in repository). 
UID number registration (listing) file is required for new account generation, 
use one at `/server/admin/github-scripts/pfs_infra_ipmu/ldap-admin/`. 

* Create target list file (see command help below)
* Execute `create-ldif.pl` script
* Execute `.cmd` file generated to run ldapadd/ldapmodify
* Load on services

  * JIRA will reload per about 30min
  * Bugzilla need to run `contrib/syncLDAP.pl -d`

::

 $ ./create-ldif.pl
 <script> <options> target_list
 options:
    --reset : execute reset (password)
    --group=<str> : enable LDAP group specified by <str>, multiple accepted
    --jira : enable JIRA access
    --shell : define user as shell access group (cannot be used with --reset)
 target_list is a filename with lines by "<email> <username> <fullname>"
    uid is taken from '00uid.list' file (last +1)
    default gid is from opt_gid (2000)
    fullname is an option, from third to the end when defined

LDAP server
------

* config root is 'cn=admin,cn=config'
* on upgrade/move, copy /etc/ldap/slapd.d and /var/lib/ldap

JIRA
----

Currently executed upgrade procedure is:

* make new VM guest with jirapipe-<version> as hostname
* make new directory /server/service/jirapipe-<version>, mount it as /service
* download new package of JIRA software
* install JIRA software

  * install target to /service/jira
  * JIRA software data to /service/jira-data

* copy jira-data from old /server/service/jirapipe-<version>/jira-data
* edit conf/server.xml to point /jira/ (path attribute of Context)

Special cases on replacing host
------

Followings are special case on replacing host using different hostname or IP 
address, which will require additional modification(s) on existing services. 

* NTP server: After replacing ntp server, change configuration not only in 
  `hosts-ipmu` but also ntp-server dhcp-option line in `dnsmasq-site.ipmu`. 
* NFS server for ``/virt``: VM host physical machines are required to be 
  configured as mounting ``/virt`` with IP address but not service canonical 
  hostname. Therefore, change ansible configuration and switch NFS mount 
  configuration in fstab with new IP address. 

Let's encrypt / certbot
------

Server certificates for PFS servers at IPMU are acquired using certbot from 
`Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`_, and used by httpd and mail 
systems. 
Certifications are automatically updated via periodic execution of certbot 
(configured into cron by its package). Although httpd(s) could be configured to 
be auto-reloaded through update process, mail systems are not, so we need to 
force reload to mail systems (and so on, if any addition we will introduce). 
For these, we configure cron job(s) to reload certification(s) instead of by 
certbot. Updates are performed per ~2 monthes, and certificates have 3 monthes 
period, cron job(s) are configured twice per month.
