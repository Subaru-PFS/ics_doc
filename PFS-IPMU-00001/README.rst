Legends in this document
------

* ``inline literal`` means canonical service name, like ``ntp``, or ``pfsdisk``
* *emphasis* means hostname without tailing revision number of VM guest 
  reinitialization (or switching to new one), like *stretch*, or *pd*

  * VM hostname has tailing `-vm`, so digit before it is hardware component ID
  * Tailing digits could be more than two, like version number of hosted 
    service like JIRA
  * In configurations, need to be referenced by canonical service name

* `solid text` means command or option
