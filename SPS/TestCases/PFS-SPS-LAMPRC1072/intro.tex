\section{Introduction}

This document describes the test cases used for demonstrating the
validity of the \acrshort{ICS} software used for SPS commanding, prior
to delivery of the SM1 module to Subaru at the end of 2019.

The intention is for these test cases to be run at \acrshort{LAM} during
the summer of 2019. A report of the outcome would then be provided to
the \acrshort{PFS} Project Office, who would then decide whether the
software is of an adequate level for use at Subaru.
