\section{Introduction}

This document describes the test cases used for demonstrating the
validity of the \acrshort{ICS} software used for SPS commanding.

These tests will be run following the conclusion of the SM1 AIT test campaign
conducted by LAM at Subaru in early 2020, and after the SpS software
has been migrated to the new infrastructure that makes use of the IIC and the
operations database. The purpose is to validate that software migration, and
to ensure that the necessary control of the SpS hardware is achieved following
the migration.

\subsection{References to the Operational Database in test cases}

This document represents tests that cover both pre- and post-migration tests. 
For the post-migration testing, the operational database will be involved.
Therefore, these test cases describe checks involving the operational database. 
As the operational database is not relevant for the {\it pre-migration} tests,
references to the operational database in the test cases should be ignored.
