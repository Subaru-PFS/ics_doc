\section{Test Case SPS-ARC-155: Acquire arc exposure}

\subsection{Description}

Take a 15 second arc exposure on a given detector. Check that the file is created correctly
and critical keys in the FITS header are set correctly. 
(Specifically, check that \texttt{IMAGETYP==ARC} and \texttt{EXPTME==15})


Check that the operations database is correctly populated.


\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] filepath and fits header keys be generated and command should finish with `\texttt{test=arc-cam,OK}', 
and that the \texttt{sps\_exposure} table is correctly populated, 
with the field \texttt{pfs\_visit\_id} set to the appropriate visit, \texttt{exptime}, 
set to the exposure time (15 seconds), and the \texttt{time\_exp\_start} \texttt{time\_exp\_end} set appropriately.
\item [Fail] If an exception is raised `\texttt{test=arc-cam,FAILED}' will be generated with its full trace, 
or that the operations database is not correctly populated.

\end{description}

\subsection{Hardware constraints}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item SPS RACK powered up
    \item \acrshort{BEE} powered up.
    \item Fee powered up
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Initial conditions}

ccdActor and testsActor started

\subsection{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item testsActor : send arc test command: \texttt{tests arc cam=r1} .
    \item wait for the command to end.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Additional Notes}
None.
