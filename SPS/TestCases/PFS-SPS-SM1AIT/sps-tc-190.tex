\section{Test Case SPS-BIA-190: Check Back Illumination Assembly Photoresistance}

\subsection{Description}

Check the communication with biasha board, check that the statuses are correct.

\noindent Turn on the BIA, check photoresistances values and check shutters interlock.

\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] The photoresistances are measured as expected. opening any shutter is forbidden `\texttt{test=bia-smId,OK}'
\item [Fail] If an exception is raised `\texttt{test=bia-smId,FAILED}' will be generated with its full trace.
\end{description}

\subsection{Hardware constraints}

Enu rack powered up and connected to the PFS network

\subsection{Initial conditions}
enuActor and testsActor started

\subsection{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item testsActor : send bia test command: \texttt{tests bia sm1} .
    \item wait for the command to end.
\end{enumerate}



\subsection{Additional Notes}
