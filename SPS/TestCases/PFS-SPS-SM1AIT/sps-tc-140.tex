\section{Test Case SPS-BIAS-140: Detector Bias}

\subsection{Description}

Take a bias on a given detector, check that the file is created correctly and fits header critical keys are set.
Check that \texttt{IMAGETYP==BIAS} and \texttt{exptime==0}

Check that the operations database is correctly populated.

\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}

\item [Pass] filepath and fits header keys be generated and command should finish with `\texttt{test=bias-cam,OK}', 
and that the \texttt{sps\_exposure} table is correctly populated, 
with the field \texttt{pfs\_visit\_id} set to the appropriate visit, \texttt{exptime}, set to 0 seconds, 
and the \texttt{time\_exp\_start} \texttt{time\_exp\_end} set such that they are equal.

\item [Fail] If an exception is raised `\texttt{test=bias-cam,FAILED}' will be generated with its full trace, 
or that the operations database is not correctly populated.

\end{description}
