Check that the operations database is correctly populated.

\subsection{Pass/Fail Condition(s)}

\begin{description}
\item [Pass] filepath and fits header keys be generated and command should finish with `\texttt{test=dark-cam,OK}',

with the field \texttt{pfs\_visit\_id} set to the appropriate visit, \texttt{exptime}, 
set to the exposure time (10 seconds), and the \texttt{time\_exp\_start} \texttt{time\_exp\_end} set appropriately.
