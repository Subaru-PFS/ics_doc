ics_doc/memo
======

This directory stores bluk (non-organized) memos and/or FAQs which could be 
useful for running or development of tron and actors 
(refer `INSTRM-284 <https://pfspipe.ipmu.jp/jira/browse/INSTRM-284>`_). 

Add new memo into files in this directory listed below, or add a new file 
with adding a short description into following list. 
This directory is for unorganized memos, no formal review process is required 
to push to the repository even for 'master', but it is recommended to update 
whole one file with the latest information when update something (to make 
checking the last updated date of contents easy just at a file listing page).
